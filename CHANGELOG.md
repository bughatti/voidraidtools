# VoidRaidTools Changelog

## 1.0.6 — 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Enable All / Disable All** bulk-toggle buttons in the panel's bottom bar. Start clean (Disable All) and re-enable only the modules you want — useful for tanks who only want LuraMemory + tank-swap modules, or DPS who only want KickRotation + per-boss alerts.

### Changed
- **Every module description rewritten** to explain what each module does on-screen AND how it complements (not duplicates) DBM. Common feedback was "I have DBM, why do I need VRT?" — the new descriptions answer that per module. KickRotation tells you whose kick to use (DBM only announces the cast). LightblindedTanks picks WHICH tank should swap and gives you the button (DBM only says "swap"). LuraMemory shows YOUR personal pattern + arrow (DBM has no per-player memory tracking). Per-boss alert modules emphasize role-filtering (DPS see kicks, healers see dispels, tanks see swaps) vs DBM's everyone-gets-everything model.

## 1.0.5 — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **Panel enable/disable checkboxes now take effect immediately for every module.** Previously the checkbox just flipped the persistent `VoidRaidToolsDB.modules[id]` flag, which gated future event dispatches but did nothing to the visible UI the module had already created. Result: unchecking Kick Rotation (or any other module with a visible frame) kept the box on-screen until `/reload`. Now `VRT:SetModuleEnabled` hides every registered movable that belongs to the toggled module, and fires `OnDisable`/`OnEnable` lifecycle callbacks for any module that wants custom logic. Works for all 13 modules with visible frames without touching their files individually — frames are matched via the existing `VRT.movables` registry (id is `<module_id>` or `<module_id>.<subid>`).
- **Kick Rotation** specifically: implements `OnDisable` (hides the floating frame) and `OnEnable` (re-runs visibility check). So unchecking the box hides the rotation immediately, re-checking brings it back if you're in a dungeon and haven't separately user-hidden it.

## 1.0.4 — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **Kick Rotation "Hide Kick Frame" now sticks across /reload, zone change, and ENCOUNTER_START.** Previously the panel button hid the frame for the current session only — any reload or boss pull silently re-showed it. Now persisted as `settings.kickrotation.user_hidden` in `VoidRaidToolsDB`. Click "Show Kick Frame" to bring it back.

## 1.0.3 — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **TankSwapDiagnostic** ring buffer no longer O(n²). The naive `while #t > cap do table.remove(t, 1) end` pattern was tripping WoW's script-time-limit watchdog during sustained 20-man raid pulls (~50+ events/sec). Replaced with a single O(n) bulk drop of the oldest 10% so the next 10% of appends are free.

### Cleanup
- **Panel.lua**: removed dead legacy `VRT_MinimapButton` block — it was duplicating with `Minimap.lua`'s hub-discoverable `VoidRaidToolsMinimapBtn`. No user-facing change; the hub button is the only minimap UI now.

## 1.0.2 — 2026-06-09 (pre-raid push)

### Fixed
- **Lura Memory** layout: box 20% smaller, status text moved above L'ura icon so the 6 o'clock shape cell no longer collides with "Oracle: YOU".
- **Lura Memory** no longer clobbers Blizzard's global `PlayerFrame` — added a local shadow declaration so the player's unit frame stays put when the Oracle legend is hidden.
- **Lura Memory** custom L'ura portrait (Darkwell scene) now loads from `Media/lura.tga` with PNG fallback.
- **Salhadaar / Vaelgor & Ezzorak / all bosses**: replaced brittle BigWigs-sourced spell IDs with a runtime-resolved engine. Configured overrides stay for known criticals; everything else gates on `C_Spell.IsSpellImportant` with the spell name resolved live via `C_Spell.GetSpellName`. Modules can no longer ship silent.

### Added
- `BossAlertEngine` shared helper — every per-boss alert module is now ~20 lines of overrides table + Attach call.
- `KickRotation:FlashAlert(duration, label)` accepts a custom label so the alert panel shows the actual spell name.
- Required-companion banner at login if `VoidRaidToolsReader` is missing.

### Hidden
- `TankSwapDiagnostic` now opt-in via `VoidRaidToolsDB.settings.debug = true` + reload. Default install no longer loads its 1k-line capture path.

## 1.0.0 — 2026-06-09

First public release.

### Modules shipped

**Raid alert modules** (ETEA-driven priority alerts per encounter):
- Imperator Averzian (3176) — Void Rupture kick, Umbral Collapse soak
- Vorasius (3177) — Blistercreep add kicks (Oozing Slam, Overload) + Backlash + Rift Madness
- Vaelgor & Ezzorak (3178) — Nullbeam + Void Howl kicks + Dread Breath dodge
- Salhadaar (3179) — Shadow Fracture kick (CRITICAL), Despotic Command dispel, Shattered Sky burn window
- Lightblinded Vanguard (3180) — Light/Void Quill kicks + Devouring Essence dispel + Sacred Shield indicator
- Crown of the Cosmos (3181) — Interrupting Tremor kick, Cosmic Barrier burn window
- Belo'ren (3182) — Color-soak alerts, Guardian's Edict tank, Eternal Burns heal absorb
- Midnight Falls / L'ura (3183) — Safeguard Prism kick (CRITICAL), Heaven's Glaives raid CD
- Chimaerus (3306) — Fearsome Cry kick, Consuming Miasma dispel

**Tank-swap router modules** (opt-in via "I go first" / "I go second"):
- Lightblinded Vanguard — Bellamy + Venel Judgement routing
- Vorasius — Smashing Frenzy 6-cycle routing
- Vaelgor & Ezzorak — dual-target tank cleave
- StackTankSwap — generic stacking-debuff router

**Mechanic helpers**:
- L'ura Memory Game — Oracle bar + radial symbol map for Heroic Midnight Falls Dark Rune
- Class Sequences — DK Grip/Grip/Kick castsequence on Chimaerus Haunting Essences

**Kick-priority pipeline**:
- KickRotation — raid-aware kick rotation tracker (party + raid units)
- MarkerScan — one-key macro to mark priority mobs via `/targetexact` + `/tm`
- MarkerKickAlert — silent until 2.7s into a marked mob's cast, then RaidWarning sound (filters Bolt from Poly via cast duration)
- MarkerOverlay — big pulsing skull above any marked nameplate (Plater-compatible)
- FocusKickBar — clean focus cast bar that auto-hides non-interruptible casts via C-side `SetAlphaFromBoolean` (the X-Wind discovery)

### Technical highlights

- All boss alert modules use the `C_EncounterEvents.GetEventInfo()` bridge to read clean spell IDs from ETEA events — works around the 12.0.5 secret-value gate on hostile cast IDs
- MarkerKickAlert uses `type(GetRaidTargetIndex(unit)) == "number"` for clean marker detection (the one comparison the secret-value system permits)
- Fingerprint matching covers the "2nd Magister" case where `/targetexact` can only mark one of a same-named pair
- Combined alert system silences unmarked mob casts so the rotation panel only fires on leader-flagged priorities

### Known limitations

- Spell IDs for some boss modules sourced from BigWigs; live ETEA captures may produce different IDs. The 2nd raid pull per boss validates this — alerts that don't fire mean the priority list needs the captured IDs swapped in.
- Crown of the Cosmos spell IDs particularly limited — only verified after Mythic kill captures.
- Tank-swap routers require explicit role claim ("I go first" / "I go second") — auto-detection of tank role on encounter start is a v1.1 goal.
